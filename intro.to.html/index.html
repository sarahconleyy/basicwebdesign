<h2>welcome!</h2>
<p> Humans find flowers beautiful because they are very unique such as other plants.
    But flowers to some represent love or passion, happiness or remembrance of a loved 
    one that was lost. Flowers are meant to be looked at as something that can bring life 
    to another plant that is dead. Flowers bring happiness and hope to many people. Flowers 
    are strong, they remain strong through the tough storms they go through. They stand tall
    as the water rains down on them soaking them completely. Flowers are beautiful because
    they can do many different things and they can be helpful to others that need love or hope.</p>
