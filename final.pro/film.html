                <h2>70s movies</h2>
                <p>Films have been a major part of pop culture for decades, and the 70s was no exception. In fact, the 70s is often considered a golden age of American cinema, thanks to the emergence
                  of new filmmakers who pushed the boundaries of traditional Hollywood fare. Directors like Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg created groundbreaking films that 
                  continue to influence filmmakers today. One of the defining characteristics of 70s films was their gritty realism. Movies like Taxi Driver, The French Connection, and Chinatown portrayed
                  a bleak and often violent world that stood in contrast to the glossy, idealized Hollywood productions of previous decades. These films reflected the tumultuous social and political climate
                  of the time, and were often characterized by anti-heroes, ambiguous endings, and nonlinear narratives. Another hallmark of 70s film pop culture was the emergence of new genres and subgenres.
                 Blaxploitation films, which starred predominantly African American casts and often dealt with issues of race and social justice, were hugely popular during this period. Horror films also
                 experienced a renaissance, with classics like The Exorcist and Jaws pushing the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in terms of violence and gore. And of course, the 70s saw the birth
                 of the modern blockbuster, with films like Jaws, Star Wars, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind breaking box office records and changing the face of Hollywood forever. <p>
