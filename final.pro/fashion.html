                <h2>funky fashion of the 70s</h2>
                <p>The 1970s was a decade of fashion experimentation and individual expression. The fashion trends of the decade were a reflection of the social and cultural changes that were taking place at the time.
                  One of the most iconic fashion trends of the 70s was the disco style. This trend was characterized by bright colors, sequins, and tight-fitting clothing. Disco fashion was all about glamour and excess,
                  with popular styles including jumpsuits, flared pants, and platform shoes. Another popular fashion trend of the 70s was the hippie style. This style was inspired by the counterculture movement of the
                  1960s and was all about embracing natural materials and free-flowing designs. Key features of the hippie style included long, flowing skirts, tie-dye shirts, and bell-bottom pants. The hippie style also
                  embraced ethnic influences, such as Native American and African designs, which were incorporated into clothing and accessories. Lastly, punk fashion emerged in the late 70s, characterized by its rebellious
                  and anti-establishment aesthetic. This trend was all about expressing individuality through unconventional clothing choices, such as ripped t-shirts, leather jackets, and safety pins. Punk fashion also
                  included bold makeup and hairstyles, such as brightly colored hair and heavy eyeliner. This trend was a response to the mainstream fashion industry, with punks rejecting the idea of conforming to 
                traditional beauty standards.</p>

              <h2>why 70s fashion is so unique</h2>
             <p>70s fashion was unique because it reflected a time of social and cultural change, with an emphasis on comfort, practicality, and diversity. Clothing became more relaxed and free-flowing,
              with natural materials becoming popular. There were many different styles and subcultures, from disco to punk to hippie, each with their own distinct look and aesthetic. This diversity 
             allowed people to express themselves in new and different ways, and paved the way for a more inclusive and accepting fashion industry.</p>
