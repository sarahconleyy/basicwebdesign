                <h2>lets take a look at the far out food of the 70s </h2>
                <p>The 1970s was a decade that saw significant changes in the way people ate and viewed food. One of the most significant changes was the rise of processed and convenience foods.
                 As more women entered the workforce, there was a growing demand for quick and easy meals that could be prepared in minutes. This led to the popularity of frozen dinners, canned foods,
                  and snack foods such as potato chips and pretzels. In addition to processed and convenience foods, there was also a growing interest in health and wellness during the 70s. This led to
                 an increase in the popularity of natural and organic foods. The first natural food stores began to appear, and people began to embrace whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
                 There was also a rise in vegetarianism and veganism, with people seeking alternatives to meat and dairy products. When it came to snacks in the 70s, some of the most popular options included
                 Twinkies, Fritos, and Tang. Twinkies were a sweet treat that had been around since the 1930s, but they became even more popular in the 70s. Fritos were a salty snack that was often paired
                 with dips or served with chili, and Tang was a powdered drink mix that was marketed as an alternative to orange juice. Other popular snacks of the era included Pop Rocks, Jell-O,
                 and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Overall, the 70s saw a significant shift in the way people ate, with a focus on convenience and health as well as indulgence.</p>

                  gained popularity, setting the stage for the future of the industry.</p>
