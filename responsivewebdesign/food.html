            <p>The main ingredients in Korean cuisine are rice, noodles, veggies, meats, and tofu (dubu in Korean).
             Typical Korean dinners include a plethora of side dishes (banchan) that are served alongside steam-cooked
             short-grain rice, soup, and kimchi (fermented, spicy vegetable banchan, most commonly cabbage, radish, or cucumber).
             Every meal is accompanied by banchan. Korean food is typically seasoned with sesame oil, doenjang (fermented soybean paste),
             soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, and gochujang (red chili paste). Before refrigeration, Koreans stored kimchi and other pickled
             vegetables underground in open courtyards throughout the winter in large ceramic vessels. This method is still practiced in some
             rural areas of South Korea. Although many Koreans living in cities buy prepared traditional food from supermarkets or outdoor markets,
             preparing Korean food needs a lot of work.</p>
             <p>Street cuisine in South Korea is a foodie's paradise. These are not only delicious, but also a terrific 
                option for economical Korean food. On the streets of South Korea, you may get a variety of meals and snacks
                ranging from sweet to savory. Insadong, Myeongdong, and Hongdae are some of the greatest areas to obtain street
               cuisine. Many travelers who visit Korea prepare a full dinner from street cuisine. To make a complete lunch,
                they eat two or three different varieties of street cuisine. Korean fried chicken, fishcake, dumplings, gimbap,
             pancakes, spicy rice cakes, and fried snacks are some of the most popular street foods in South Korea.</p>

            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Confucian ideas have had a great influence on Korean society, which affects not only personal life
               but also business. Confucianism promotes social peace, respect for elders and authority, family,
               friendship, and ancestors, as well as tradition.</p>

            <h3>Cuisine</h3>
            <p>Korean food has developed throughout ages as a result of social and political upheaval. Korean cuisine,
               which evolved from old agricultural and nomadic practices in Korea and southern Manchuria, exhibits a complex
               interaction of the natural environment and several cultural influences.</p>
