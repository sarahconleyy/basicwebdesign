            <h2>Korean Culture</h2>
            <p>Korean culture includes the country's history, customs, traditions, and beliefs. It has been shaped
               by each of its numerous dynasties, wars, changes in religious beliefs, global modernism, and many more
               practices and traditions that have been passed down through centuries, with subtle variations with each
               generational pass. The long-standing tensions between North and South Korea, which were separated in 1945,
               continue to shape both countries today.Korean culture also includes its food, holidays, national sports,
               and cultural conventions, as well as its popular culture in the form of music, movies, dramas, and fashion.
               And these are only a few of the little elements that make up the culture as a whole.</p>

            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Confucian ideas have had a great influence on Korean society, which affects not only personal life
               but also business. Confucianism promotes social peace, respect for elders and authority, family,
               friendship, and ancestors, as well as tradition.</p>

            <h3>Cuisine</h3>
            <p>Korean food has developed throughout ages as a result of social and political upheaval. Korean cuisine,
               which evolved from old agricultural and nomadic practices in Korea and southern Manchuria, exhibits a complex
               interaction of the natural environment and several cultural influences.</p>
