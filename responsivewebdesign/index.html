            <p>Korea's large metropolitan centers, extensive parks and recreation facilities, high-tech infrastructure,
               and ultramodern public transit systems are just a few of the factors that have helped Korea become a 
               well-known international business and travel destination. Seoul Olympic Park, located in the capital city
               of Seoul, preserves the spirit of the 1988 Summer Olympics and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
               with multipurpose areas for sports, recreation, and a range of cultural activities.
               South Korea is still one of the most ethnically homogeneous countries in the world. South Koreans are thought to
               be direct ancestors of various migrating Mongol tribes who arrived on the Korean Peninsula about a half million 
               years ago. South Korea now has a population of around 49 million people, making it one of the world's most densely
               inhabited countries. South Korea now has diplomatic connections with approximately 170 countries.</p>
